# Active Context

## Current State
The application is fully implemented with a complete GUI interface and core functionality:
- PySide6-based GUI application
- Worker thread implementation for processing
- FFmpeg integration for audio extraction
- SRT subtitle parsing
- Parallel processing capability

## Recent Changes
- Analyzed main.py implementation
- Created initial documentation
- Set up version control:
  - Initialized git repository
  - Created .gitignore for Python
  - Added requirements.txt
  - Made initial commit
- Implemented virtual environment management:
  - Created cross-platform setup scripts (setup.sh/setup.bat)
  - Created cross-platform start scripts (start.sh/start.bat)
  - Added environment validation checks
  - Automated virtual environment activation
  - Added FFmpeg installation checks
  - Updated documentation with environment instructions
- Confirmed working features:
  - Video and subtitle file input
  - Output folder selection
  - Progress tracking
  - Parallel processing
  - Error handling

## Next Steps
1. Environment Testing:
   - Test setup scripts on different platforms
   - Verify dependency installation
   - Validate FFmpeg detection
   - Test virtual environment isolation
   - Verify start script error handling

2. Testing Requirements:
   - Test with various video formats
   - Test with different subtitle file encodings
   - Verify parallel processing performance
   - Validate error handling scenarios

2. Potential Improvements:
   - Add support for additional subtitle formats beyond SRT
   - Implement configuration for audio quality settings
   - Add preview functionality for subtitle segments
   - Consider batch processing multiple videos
   - Add option to customize parallel processing worker count

3. Documentation Needs:
   - User guide for installation and usage
   - FFmpeg installation instructions
   - System requirements documentation
   - Performance optimization guidelines
