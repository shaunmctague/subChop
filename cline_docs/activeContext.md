  - Progress tracking
  - Parallel processing
  - Error handling

## Next Steps
1. Testing Requirements:
   - Test with various video formats
   - Test with different subtitle file encodings
   - Verify parallel processing performance
   - Validate error handling scenarios

2. Potential Improvements:
   - Add support for additional subtitle formats beyond SRT
   - Implement configuration for audio quality settings
   - Add preview functionality for subtitle segments
   - Consider batch processing multiple videos
   - Add option to customize parallel processing worker count

3. Documentation Needs:
   - User guide for installation and usage
   - FFmpeg installation instructions
   - System requirements documentation
   - Performance optimization guidelines
